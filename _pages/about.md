Hello! I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. I am advised by Prof [Wynne Hsu](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~whsu/) and Prof [Mong Li Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leeml/). My research interests lie in out-of-distribution generalization, AI for healthcare, and medical images. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the School of Computing, National University of Singapore in 2021. My thesis was advised by Prof [Zhiyong Huang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~huangzy/).
